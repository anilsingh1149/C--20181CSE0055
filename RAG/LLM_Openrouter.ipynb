            "### **3. Ethics (Moral Philosophy)**\n",
            "   - Investigates right and wrong, good and evil, and how we should live.\n",

Here are the key principles:\n",
            "\n",
            "### **1. Bhakti Yoga (Devotional Service to Krishna)**\n",
            "   - The ultimate goal is to develop **pure love (prema)** for **Krishna**, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\n",
            "   - Devotion is the highest path to spiritual perfection, surpassing karma (fruitive work) and jnana (philosophical knowledge).\n",
            "   - Chanting the **Hare Krishna Maha Mantra** (\"Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare\") is a central practice.\n",
            "\n",
            "### **2. The Soul (Atman) and Reincarnation**\n",
            "   - Every living being is an eternal soul (**jiva**) who is part of Krishna but not equal to Him.\n",
            "   - The soul transmigrates through different bodies based on karma until it attains liberation (**moksha**) through devotion.\n",
            "   - The material world is a temporary, illusory (**maya**) place of suffering caused by forgetfulness of Krishna.\n",
            "\n",
            "### **3. Krishna as the Supreme God**\n",
            "   - Krishna is the **original source** of all incarnations (like Rama, Vishnu, Buddha, etc.).\n",
            "   - He is described in the **Bhagavad Gita** (Chapter 10) as the ultimate cause of all causes.\n",
            "   - The **Srimad Bhagavatam** (Bhagavata Purana) presents Krishna’s pastimes in Vrindavan as the highest divine love.\n",
            "\n",
            "### **4. The Four Regulatory Principles**\n",
            "   ISKCON followers abide by these guidelines to purify the mind:\n",
            "   - **No meat-eating** (including fish, eggs, and onions/garlic).\n",
            "   - **No intoxication** (alcohol, drugs, tobacco).\n",
            "   - **No illicit sex** (only within marriage for procreation and love).\n",
            "   - **No gambling** (as it leads to material greed).\n",
            "\n",
            "### **5. Simple Living & Devotional Practices**\n",
            "   - Daily chanting of **16 rounds of the Hare Krishna mantra** (on prayer beads).\n",
            "   - Offering food to Krishna (**prasadam**) before eating.\n",
            "   - Reading scriptures like **Bhagavad Gita** and **Bhagavatam**.\n",
            "   - Participating in temple worship and festivals like **Janmashtami** (Krishna’s birthday).\n",
            "\n",
            "### **6. Social & Ethical Values**\n",
            "   - **Non-violence (ahimsa)** – Compassion for all living beings.\n",
            "   - **Truthfulness** – Honesty in words and actions.\n",
            "   - **Service (seva)** – Helping others as an offering to Krishna.\n",
            "   - **Equal Vision** – Seeing all beings as spiritual souls, not just material bodies.\n",
            "\n",
            "### **7. The Four Goals of Human Life (Purusharthas)**\n",
            "   - **Dharma** (righteousness) – Living morally.\n",
            "   - **Artha** (prosperity) – Earning honestly.\n",
            "   - **Kama** (legitimate desires) – Fulfilling needs within spiritual limits.\n",
            "   - **Moksha** (liberation) – Attaining Krishna’s love.\n",

            "### **Conclusion**\n",
            "ISKCON philosophy emphasizes **loving devotional service (bhakti)** to Krishna as the highest path to spiritual fulfillment. By practicing the principles of **Bhagavad Gita**, **Srimad Bhagavatam**, and **Srila Prabhupada’s teachings**, devotees strive to transcend material suffering and achieve eternal happiness in Krishna’s service.\n",
